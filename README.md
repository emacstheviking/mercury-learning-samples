# What's here ?

I've been learning to use Mercury for about two years now, using it pretty
much every day for an hour or three, towards building a language transpiler,
but that's another story!

Along the way, I soon found out that not many people have heard of Mercury, it
started life in 1995, three years before Haskell. It's time is coming,
especially if I can help the cause.

The one thing that I found hard to find was good clear concise examples of
some of the features of the language, the official documentation is the
definitive reference and as such, not particularly friendly towards people
learning the language. To that end I offer...

## Clean Examples!

I have created various sub-folders that are hopefully meaningfully named,
meaning that when you are learning and looking for some example code to steal
/ read that you should find it easily.
